          <p>We Will Win! is first and foremost an act of revolutionary labor. Over a dozen contributors gave their time and effort to bring together a zine full of artwork that illustrates protest chants and depicts victory. In this zine, we envision a world in which the population has taken to the streets, taken change into their own hands, and won! We also feature writing that serves as a guide along our journey to that world.</p>
          <p>
            You can download the zine for web viewing
            <a href='documents/wewillwinzine_web.pdf'>here.</a>
